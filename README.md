# SiemenProject - Dockerized FastAPI Producer & C# Consumer

## Overview
This project implements a **producer-consumer** model where:

- **A C# consumer** fetches and processes the data via an **HTTP request**.
- Both services run inside **Docker containers and are orchestrated** using Docker Compose.
